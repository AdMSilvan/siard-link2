# Siard.link: Mapping SIARD to SIARD-RDF
This Project, developed by Tobias Wildi (@Wildit), maps the data structure of the SIARD database archiving format to a linked data ontology. 
The documentation page hosted in this repo describes the structure of the mapping and the resulting SIARD-RDF ontology.
The repo will also contain example files which show the SIARD-RDF ontology in turtle format.
This version is not based on the final version of siard2rdf. Because at this time (August 15) siard2rdf is not yet finalized.
