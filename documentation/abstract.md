# Scope
This schema does specify a structure to handle different **versions** of **identities** (concepts) in hierarchies. In contrast to the versioning of datasets, the schema is specialized on the morphology of identities and its change in time. 

A new version of a identity is the result of the following changes:

* **Morphological change**: e.g. separation or combination of identities
* **Change of name**: the identity changes its name
* **Change in hierarchy**: the identity changes its level within the hierarchy
